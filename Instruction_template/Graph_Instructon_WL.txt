You are GraphGPT, you will be given a full graph, your first mission is to extract graph object in the format of I give you, the graph may have weight, so there are two types.
Please note that the edges of the graph object to be extracted are not necessarily sorted in ascending order, so just extract them in the given order.
Here are some examples:
has weight:
    Input:
    Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that determines use which API to complete the task.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven an weighted undirected graph, The edges are: [(0, 1, {'weight': 1}), (0, 5, {'weight': 9}), (0, 6, {'weight': 6}), (0, 7, {'weight': 2}), (0, 8, {'weight': 2}), (0, 9, {'weight': 9}), (0, 10, {'weight': 5}), (0, 2, {'weight': 9})]. The task is: you need to determine Determine the number of nodes in the graph.\n\n### Response:",   
    Output:
    G: [(0, 1, {'weight': 1}), (0, 5, {'weight': 9}), (0, 6, {'weight': 6}), (0, 7, {'weight': 2}), (0, 8, {'weight': 2}), (0, 9, {'weight': 9}), (0, 10, {'weight': 5}), (0, 2, {'weight': 9})]"
without weight:
    Input:
    Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that determines use which API to complete the task .\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven an undirected graph, the edges are: [(5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5)]. The task is: you need to Check if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The nodes in question are: path_source=10, path_target=12.\n\n### Response:",
    Output:
    G: [(5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5)]

Before you extract,there is on thing you should be aware of: "The nodes in question are: path_source=10, path_target=12." such descriptions in question refers to the target nodes, which should not be included in Graph list.
And do not create edge which does exist. 
Now here is a new task:
Input:

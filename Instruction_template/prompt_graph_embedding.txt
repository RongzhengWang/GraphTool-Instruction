You are GraphGPT, you will be given a full graph with embeddings, your first mission is to extract graph embeddings.Ignore the question in the input, just extract the graph embeddings.
Here are some examples:
Input:
In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and every node has an embedding. (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.\nEmbeddings:\nnode 0: [1,1]\nnode 1: [1,0]\nnode 2: [1,1]\nnode 3: [0,0]\nnode 4: [0,0]\nThe edges are: (0,1) (0,3) (2,3) (3,4)\nIn a simple graph convolution layer, each node's embedding is updated by the sum of its neighbors' embeddings.\nQ: What's the embedding of each node after two layers of simple graph convolution layer?\nA:
Output:
Embeddings: node 0: [1,1] node 1: [1,0] node 2: [1,1] node 3: [0,0] node 4: [0,0]

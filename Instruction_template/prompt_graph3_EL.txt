You are GraphGPT, and you will be assigned a graph reasoning task along with a graph path. Your initial task is to extract the graph object. The graph object is stored in an edgelist file; you only need to provide me with the file path, and I will return the graph object to you.
Here are some examples:
Input:
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that determines use which API to complete the task.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven a directed graph and a path,  The edges are in the egdelist file, the path is: /home/data2t2/wrz/Graph Tools/1EL_graph/All_type_mission_directed/twice/data/shortest0.edgelist. The task is: you need to Find the minimum distance between a given pair of nodes. The nodes in question are (16, 12).\n\n### Response:
Output:
path: "/home/data2t2/wrz/Graph Tools/1EL_graph/All_type_mission_directed/twice/data/shortest0.edgelist" 
Now here is a new task:
Input:

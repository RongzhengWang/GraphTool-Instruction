You are GraphGPT, you will be given a bipartite graph, your first mission is to extract graph object in the format of I give you.
Please note that the some nodes may not have edge so just remian empty.
Here are some examples:
Input:
    There are 4 job applicants numbered from 0 to 3, and 2 jobs numbered from 0 to 1. Each applicant is interested in some of the jobs. Each job can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job.\nApplicant 0 is interested in job 1.\nApplicant 0 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 1 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 2 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 2 is interested in job 1.\nApplicant 3 is interested in job 1.\nApplicant 3 is interested in job 0.\nQ: Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that the maximum number of applicants find the job they are interested in.\nA:   
Output:
    G = {
        0: [1, 0],
        1: [0],
        2: [0, 1],
        3: [1, 0],
    }

	    1: [],    
	    2: [1],    
	    3: [0, 1],
    },
Input:
    There are 6 job applicants numbered from 0 to 5, and 4 jobs numbered from 0 to 3. Each applicant is interested in some of the jobs. Each job can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job.\nApplicant 0 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 0 is interested in job 2.\nApplicant 1 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 1 is interested in job 3.\nApplicant 1 is interested in job 2.\nApplicant 2 is interested in job 2.\nApplicant 2 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 3 is interested in job 3.\nApplicant 3 is interested in job 1.\nApplicant 3 is interested in job 2.\nApplicant 4 is interested in job 0.\nApplicant 4 is interested in job 3.\nApplicant 5 is interested in job 2.\nQ: Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that the maximum number of applicants find the job they are interested in.\nA:
Output:
    G = {    
	0: [0, 2],    
	1: [0, 3, 2],    
	2: [2, 0],    
	3: [3, 1, 2],    
	4: [0, 3],    
	5: [2],
    },

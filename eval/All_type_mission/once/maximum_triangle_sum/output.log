To solve this task, we need to find the triangle with the highest total weight. We can do this by iterating through all the edges and checking if they form a triangle. If they do, we calculate the total weight of the triangle and update the maximum weight if necessary.

API_name: maximum_triangle_sum
API_Input: G (the given graph)

The graph G is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of three elements: the source node, the target node, and a dictionary containing the weight of the edge. For example, the edge (0, 2, {'weight': 74}) represents an edge from node 0 to node 2 with a weight of 74.

We can use the maximum_triangle_sum API to find the maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes in the graph G. This API takes the graph G as input and returns the maximum sum of weights.

Here's the Python code to solve the task:
```
def find_max_triangle_weight(G):
    max_weight = 0
    for edge1 in G:
        for edge2 in G:
            if edge1[0] == edge2[0] and edge1[1]!= edge2[1]:
                for edge3 in G:
                    if edge1[0]!= edge3[0] and edge1[1]!= edge3[1] and edge2[0]!= edge3[0] and edge2[1]!= edge3[1]:
                        if edge1[1] == edge3[0] and edge2[1] == edge3[1]:
                            weight = edge1[2]['weight'] + edge2[2]['weight'] + edge3[2]['weight']
                            if weight > max_weight:
                                max_weight = weight
    return max_weight

G = [(0, 2, {'weight': 74}), (0, 3, {'weight': 62}),..., (22, 24, {'weight': 63})]
max_weight = find_max_triangle_weight(G)
print(max_weight)
```
This code iterates through all the edges in the graph G and checks if they form a triangle. If they do, it calculates the total weight of the triangle and updates the maximum weight if necessary. Finally, it returns the maximum weight.

Note that this code assumes that the graph G is undirected and contains no duplicate edges. If the graph is directed or contains duplicate edges, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

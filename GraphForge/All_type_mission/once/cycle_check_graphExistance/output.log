Thought:
We need to determine whether there is a closed path in the graph. A closed path is a path that starts and ends at the same node. We can use the 'is_path_graphExistance' API to check if a path exists between two nodes, and then check if the path closes back to the starting node.

API_name: is_path_graphExistance
API_Input: (graph=G, path_source=node, path_target=node)

We will start by choosing an arbitrary node as the starting node. Let's say the starting node is 0. Then, we will iterate through all the nodes in the graph and check if there is a path from the starting node to each node. If we find a node that has a path back to the starting node, then we know that there is a closed path in the graph.

Let's start by finding all the nodes that are connected to the starting node 0. We can do this by calling the 'is_node_graphExistance' API with the graph G and the node 0 as input.

API_name: is_node_graphExistance
API_Input: (graph=G, node=0)

If the API returns True, then node 0 exists in the graph. Now, we can iterate through all the nodes that are connected to node 0 and check if there is a path from node 0 to each of these nodes. We can do this by calling the 'is_path_graphExistance' API with the graph G, node 0 as the source node, and each of the connected nodes as the target node.

API_name: is_path_graphExistance
API_Input: (graph=G, path_source=0, path_target=node)

If we find a node that has a path back to node 0, then we know that there is a closed path in the graph. We can repeat this process for all the nodes in the graph to find all the closed paths.

Let's start with the first node that is connected to node 0, which is node 1. We can call the 'is_path_graphExistance' API with the graph G, node 0 as the source node, and node 1 as the target node.

API_name: is_path_graphExistance
API_Input: (graph=G, path_source=0, path_target=1)

If the API returns True, then there is a path from node 0 to node 1. We can then check if there is a path from node 1 back to node 0. If there is, then we know that there is a closed path that starts and ends at node 0.

We can repeat this process for all the nodes in the graph to find all the closed paths.

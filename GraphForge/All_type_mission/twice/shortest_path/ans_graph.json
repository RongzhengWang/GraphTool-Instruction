To identify the shortest connection between two nodes (10, 2), we need to perform a shortest path search.\n\nThe shortest path search algorithm that can be used in this case is Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority of each node is its distance from the starting node.

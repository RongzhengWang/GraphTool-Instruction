To determine the shortest path between two specific nodes in the graph, we can use the'shortest_path' API. This API takes a graph, a source node, and a target node as input and returns the shortest path between the two nodes.

API_name: shortest_path
API_Input: (graph = G, path_source = 7, path_target = 15)

Please note that the graph G is the input graph provided in the task description, and the path_source and path_target are the nodes we are trying to find the shortest path between.

Thought:
The task requires finding the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is undirected and weighted.

API_name: shortest_path

API_Input: (G, 8, 9)

Explanation:
The shortest_path API is suitable for this task as it can find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. The input to the API is the graph G and the source and target nodes, which are 8 and 9 respectively.

torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.55 GiB. GPU  has a total capacity of 15.57 GiB of which 1.19 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 14.37 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.46 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.79 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

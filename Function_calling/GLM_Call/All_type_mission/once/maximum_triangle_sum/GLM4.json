The maximum sum obtained will be the answer.\n\nWe can use a function from the `networkx` library in Python, called `maximum_triangle_sum`, to accomplish this task.

(add all the edges given in the input)\n\n# Calculate the maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes\nmax_sum = nx.maximum_triangle_sum(G)\n\nprint(\"The maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes is:\", max_sum)\n```\n\nThis code will create an undirected graph with the given edges and weights, and then calculate the maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes using the `maximum_triangle_sum` function.",

Since the graph is undirected, we can consider it as an undirected weighted graph.\n\nTo solve this task, we can use the `maximum_triangle_sum` function from the `graph` module. This function takes an undirected graph as input and returns the maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `maximum_triangle_sum`

(other edges)\n    (25, 26, {'weight': 42})\n]\nprint(maximum_triangle_sum(graph))\n```\n\nThis implementation will give us the maximum sum of weights for any connected triplet of nodes in the given graph.",

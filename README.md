# GraphTool-Instruction
This repo contains the code, data, and models for "GraphTool-Instruction: Revolutionizing Graph Reasoning in LLMs through Decomposed Subtask Instruction."


This project aims at leveraging instruction-tuning to build a powerful instruction-following LLM that can map textural descriptions of graphs and structures, and then solve different graph problems explicitly in natural language.

To accomplish this, we make the following works:
# GraphWiz, a series of instruction-following LLMs that have strong graph problem-solving abilities and output explicit reasoning paths.
# GraphInstruct, which offers over 72.5k training samples across nine graph problem tasks, ranging in complexity from linear and polynomial to NP-complete, extending the scope, scale, and diversity of previous benchmarks.
